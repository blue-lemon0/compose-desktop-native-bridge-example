# Bubble Wrap 🫧

A tiny, deliberately silly **Material 3 bubble-wrap simulator** - and a
complete consumer example for
[compose-desktop-native](https://github.com/bitsycore/compose-desktop-native)'s
**bridge plugin**: one shared Compose Multiplatform codebase that runs

- on **Android** (Google's androidx.compose artifacts),
- on **upstream Compose Desktop** (JVM), and
- as **self-contained native executables** - Windows (mingwX64), Linux
  (x64 / arm64) and macOS (arm64) - **no JVM**, rendering through SDL3/Skia.

Pop bubbles, resize them with a slider, flip dark/light, get a fresh sheet.
Bouncy spring physics included. The bubble logo and the strings come from
**`composeResources/`** - same files, same generated `Res.*` accessors on
every platform; on the native targets the bridge bundles them into
`data.kres` next to the executable automatically.

## Layout

Two modules, the current Android-recommended shape for a KMP app:

- **`:shared`** - the whole app as a Compose Multiplatform library. The
  Android target comes from AGP's KMP library plugin
  (`com.android.kotlin.multiplatform.library`), declared as
  `androidLibrary {}` right inside the `kotlin {}` block - no `android {}`
  block, no manifest. The jvm/native desktop entry points and the bridge
  plugin live here too.
- **`:androidApp`** - a plain `com.android.application` module: one
  Activity, one manifest, `implementation(project(":shared"))`.

## The point

`shared/src/commonMain` contains only plain Compose code against the
**official** `androidx.compose.*` API, and `shared/build.gradle.kts` declares
only the **official** `org.jetbrains.compose.*` coordinates. One line in
`settings.gradle.kts` does the rest:

```kotlin
plugins { id("com.bitsycore.compose-desktop-native.bridge") version "0.4.1" }
```

On the Kotlin/Native desktop targets the plugin substitutes
compose-desktop-native's klibs for those coordinates; every other target keeps
resolving upstream - on **Android**, JetBrains' own artifacts already redirect
to Google's `androidx.compose.*`, the exact same trick one layer up. SDL3 and
its codecs ship as static archives *inside* the klibs - nothing to install,
and a distributable is just the executable.

## Setup

The artifacts live on GitHub Packages, which requires authentication even for
public downloads. Put a classic PAT with `read:packages` in
`~/.gradle/gradle.properties`:

```properties
gpr.user=<your-github-username>
gpr.token=<your-pat>
```

## Run

```bash
# Native - self-contained executable, no JVM
./gradlew :shared:runDebugExecutableMingwX64      # Windows
./gradlew :shared:runDebugExecutableLinuxX64      # Linux
./gradlew :shared:runDebugExecutableMacosArm64    # macOS (Apple Silicon)

# Upstream Compose Desktop (JVM) - the same App()
./gradlew :shared:run

# Android - the same App() on androidx.compose
./gradlew :androidApp:installDebug        # or open in Android Studio
```

Linux needs the usual GL/X11/fontconfig dev basics at link time
(`libfontconfig-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libx11-dev`).

## Developing against a local build of the port

Publish snapshots from a compose-desktop-native checkout
(`publishMingwX64PublicationToMavenLocal publishKotlinMultiplatformPublicationToMavenLocal
:compose-desktop-native-bridge:publishToMavenLocal`), then:

```bash
./gradlew :shared:runDebugExecutableMingwX64 \
  -PbridgeVersion=0.0.0-SNAPSHOT \
  -PcomposeDesktopNativeVersion=0.0.0-SNAPSHOT
```
